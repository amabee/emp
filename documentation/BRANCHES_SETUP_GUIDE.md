## ‚úÖ What Was Created

### Database Layer
1. **Migration File**: `dbs/migrations/add_branches_feature.sql`
   - Creates `branches` table
   - Adds `branch_id` to `employees` table
   - Includes sample data (3 branches)
   - Includes rollback script

### Backend (PHP)
2. **Controller Methods** in `controllers/OrganizationController.php`:
   - `getAllBranches()` - Fetch all branches
   - `getBranch($id)` - Get single branch
   - `addBranch($data)` - Create new branch
   - `updateBranch($id, $data)` - Update branch
   - `deleteBranch($id)` - Delete branch (with safety check)

3. **AJAX Endpoints** (5 files in `ajax/`):
   - `add_branch.php` - Create branch
   - `get_branches.php` - List all branches
   - `get_branch.php` - Get single branch
   - `update_branch.php` - Update branch
   - `delete_branch.php` - Delete branch

### Frontend
4. **UI Components**:
   - `pages/modals/branch_modals.php` - Add/Edit modals
   - Updated `pages/organization-settings.php` - Added branches section
   - `assets/js/branch-management.js` - Complete JavaScript logic

### Documentation
5. **Documentation Files**:
   - `documentation/BRANCHES_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Full guide
   - `dbs/migrations/quick_setup_branches.sql` - Quick setup

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ branch_name
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ branch_code (UNIQUE)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ address
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contact_number
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manager_id (FK -> employees.employee_id)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Branches not showing?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database connection
3. Check that user has proper permissions
4. View Network tab to see AJAX responses

### Cannot delete branch?
Make sure no active employees are assigned to that branch.

### "Branch code already exists" error?
Each branch code must be unique. Use different codes or leave empty.

### Modal not opening?
Ensure Bootstrap JS is loaded properly.
