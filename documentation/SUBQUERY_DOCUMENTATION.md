# 📊 Advanced Dashboard Statistics with Subqueries

## 🎯 Overview
This documentation covers the implementation of 5 different types of SQL subqueries used exclusively for data display and analytics in the Employee Management System dashboard. These subqueries enhance the dashboard with powerful insights while keeping CRUD operations simple and fast.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Files Modified:
- `controllers/DashboardController.php` - Backend logic with subqueries
- `pages/dashboard.php` - Frontend display with new analytics cards
- `ajax/get_dashboard_data.php` - AJAX endpoint (no changes needed)

---

## 🔍 Subquery Types Implemented

### 1. 📈 **SCALAR SUBQUERIES**
**Purpose**: Get single aggregate values in one query  
**Location**: `DashboardController::getDashboardStats()`

```sql
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE employment_status = 1) as total_employees,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees 
     WHERE employment_status = 1 
     AND date_hired >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)) as new_employees_this_month,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department_name) FROM department) as total_departments,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE active_status = 'active') as total_users,
    (SELECT COALESCE(AVG(rating), 0) FROM performance) as avg_performance_rating
```

**What it does**:
- Executes multiple counts/averages in a single database call
- More efficient than separate queries
- Provides basic dashboard statistics

**Dashboard Display**:
- Total Employees card
- Total Departments card  
- Active Users card
- Average Performance Rating card

---

### 2. 🔗 **CORRELATED SUBQUERIES**
**Purpose**: Department-wise performance analysis  
**Location**: `DashboardController::getDashboardStats()`

```sql
SELECT 
    d.department_name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees e 
     WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id AND e.employment_status = 1) as employee_count,
    (SELECT COALESCE(AVG(p.rating), 0) 
     FROM performance p 
     JOIN employees e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id 
     WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id) as dept_avg_performance
FROM department d
ORDER BY dept_avg_performance DESC
LIMIT 3
```

**What it does**:
- For each department, calculates employee count and average performance
- Inner queries reference outer query's department (`d.department_id`)
- Ranks departments by performance

**Dashboard Display**:
- "🏆 Top Performing Departments" card
- Shows top 3 departments with employee counts and ratings
- Visual ranking with trophy/medal icons

---

### 3. ✅ **EXISTS SUBQUERIES**
**Purpose**: Find employees with recent performance evaluations  
**Location**: `DashboardController::getDashboardStats()`

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as count
FROM employees e
WHERE employment_status = 1 
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM performance p 
    WHERE p.employee_id = e.employee_id 
    AND p.period_end >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)
)
```

**What it does**:
- Counts employees who have performance evaluations in last 6 months
- Uses EXISTS for efficient checking of related records
- No actual data from performance table needed, just existence

**Dashboard Display**:
- "Recent Evaluations" card
- Shows count of employees with recent performance reviews

---

### 4. 📋 **IN/NOT IN SUBQUERIES**
**Purpose**: Leave statistics and filtering  
**Location**: `DashboardController::getDashboardStats()`

```sql
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leave_requests WHERE status = 'pending') as pending_leaves,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) 
     FROM employees 
     WHERE employee_id IN (
         SELECT DISTINCT employee_id FROM leave_requests 
         WHERE status = 'approved' 
         AND leave_start >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 3 MONTH)
     )) as employees_with_recent_leaves
```

**What it does**:
- Counts pending leave requests
- Uses IN subquery to find employees who had approved leaves in last 3 months
- Efficient filtering using subquery results

**Dashboard Display**:
- "📊 Leave Analytics" card with two metrics:
  - Recent Leaves: Employees with leaves in last 3 months
  - Pending: Current pending leave requests

---

### 5. 💰 **MULTIROW SUBQUERIES**
**Purpose**: Salary and compensation analysis  
**Location**: `DashboardController::getDashboardStats()`

```sql
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees e 
     WHERE e.employee_id IN (
         SELECT ea.employee_id FROM employee_allowance ea
     )) as employees_with_allowances,
    (SELECT COALESCE(AVG(basic_salary), 0) FROM employees WHERE employment_status = 1) as avg_basic_salary,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees e
     WHERE e.basic_salary > (
         SELECT AVG(basic_salary) FROM employees WHERE employment_status = 1
     )) as above_avg_salary_count
```

**What it does**:
- Counts employees with allowances using IN subquery
- Calculates average salary across all active employees
- Counts employees earning above average (subquery in WHERE clause)

**Dashboard Display**:
- "Avg Salary" card with formatted currency
- "With Allowances" card showing count
- Dynamic indicator showing how many employees earn above average

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

### New Dashboard Cards Added:

1. **Average Performance** - Scalar subquery result
2. **Recent Evaluations** - EXISTS subquery result  
3. **Average Salary** - Multirow subquery with above-average indicator
4. **With Allowances** - IN subquery result
5. **Top Performing Departments** - Correlated subquery results with ranking
6. **Leave Analytics** - IN/NOT IN subquery results

### JavaScript Functions:

```javascript
function updateDashboardStats(stats) {
    // Populate all new analytics cards
    $('#avgPerformanceRating').text(stats.avg_performance_rating || '0.0');
    $('#recentEvaluations').text(stats.employees_with_recent_evaluations || '0');
    $('#avgBasicSalary').text('₱' + new Intl.NumberFormat().format(avgSalary));
    $('#employeesWithAllowances').text(stats.employees_with_allowances || '0');
    updateTopDepartments(stats.top_performing_departments || []);
}

function updateTopDepartments(departments) {
    // Renders top 3 departments with visual ranking
    // Trophy, medal, and award icons for top 3
}
```

         WHERE EXISTS (
             SELECT 1 FROM training_records t 
             WHERE t.employee_id = e.employee_id 
             AND t.completion_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
         )) as employees_with_recent_training
");
```
