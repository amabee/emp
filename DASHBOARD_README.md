# Dashboard Integration - Employee Management System

## Overview
The dashboard has been fully integrated with dynamic functionality, replacing all hardcoded values with real data from your database.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Dashboard Controller (`controllers/DashboardController.php`)
- **getDashboardStats()**: Retrieves employee counts, growth metrics, pending leaves, departments, and users
- **getRecentActivity()**: Fetches recent employee additions and leave requests
- **getAttendanceData()**: Provides placeholder attendance data for charts
- **getDepartmentStats()**: Returns department information with employee counts

### 2. AJAX Endpoint (`ajax/get_dashboard_data.php`)
- Single endpoint that combines all dashboard data
- Handles authentication and error scenarios
- Returns JSON response with stats, activities, attendance, and departments

### 3. Dynamic Dashboard (`pages/dashboard.php`)
Enhanced with:
- **Real-time stats**: Total employees, pending leaves, departments, active users
- **Growth indicators**: Monthly employee growth percentage
- **Recent activity feed**: Shows new employee additions and leave requests
- **Department overview**: Top 5 departments with employee counts
- **Quick action buttons**: Direct links to key management pages
- **Interactive charts**: Attendance overview with ApexCharts
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 5 minutes automatically
- **Manual refresh**: Button to update data on demand

### 4. Custom Styling (`assets/css/dashboard.css`)
- Hover effects for stat cards
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design improvements
- Custom scrollbars and loading states

## Features

### Statistics Cards
1. **Total Employees** - Shows current employee count with growth percentage
2. **Pending Leaves** - Displays leave requests requiring attention
3. **Departments** - Total number of active departments
4. **Active Users** - Number of active system users

### Interactive Elements
- **Recent Activity Feed**: Real-time updates of system activities
- **Department Overview**: Quick view of departments and their sizes
- **Quick Actions**: One-click access to key functions
- **Attendance Chart**: Visual representation of attendance data

### User Experience
- **Auto-refresh**: Dashboard updates every 5 minutes
- **Manual refresh**: Button to force data update
- **Error handling**: Graceful error states with retry options
- **Loading states**: Smooth loading animations
- **Responsive design**: Works on all screen sizes

## Quick Actions Available
1. **Add Employee** → `employee-management.php`
2. **View Reports** → `reports.php`
3. **Manage Departments** → `organization-settings.php`
4. **User Management** → `user-management.php`
5. **System Settings** → `system-settings.php`

## How It Works

1. **Page Load**: Dashboard loads with loading placeholders
2. **AJAX Call**: Fetches data from `get_dashboard_data.php`
3. **Data Population**: Updates all dashboard elements with real data
4. **Auto-refresh**: Continues to update every 5 minutes
5. **User Interaction**: Manual refresh and quick actions available

## Error Handling
- Database connection failures are handled gracefully
- Missing tables (like leave_requests) don't break the dashboard
- Network errors show retry options
- All errors are logged to console for debugging

## Customization
You can easily customize:
- Refresh interval (currently 5 minutes)
- Number of recent activities shown (currently 5)
- Statistics displayed
- Quick action buttons
- Chart data and styling

The dashboard is now fully functional and integrates seamlessly with your existing employee management system!
